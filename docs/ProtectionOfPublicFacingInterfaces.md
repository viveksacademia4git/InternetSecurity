# Protection of Public-Facing Interfaces

- It is very essential to protect them from public view. Having an interface in the open view makes them a clear target and susceptible to malicious attacks.
- The ways through which they can be encapsulated from being in open are:
    - Hide them behind the company or organization network.
    - Allow only application or application units to have contact with these interfaces.
    - Allow people to connect them from within LAN. For administration purpose provide another secured interface or VPN with strict rights[4].
    - It may be possible that the Public Facing Interfaces can be exploited indirectly through the authorized application or application unit which in result might release the information that can be malicious for attackers, therefore, it is essential to have the unit tests and component vulnerability test.
