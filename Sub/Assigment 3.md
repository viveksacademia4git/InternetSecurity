## Exercise 2: Cross-Site Scripting
1. Look for a place, where you can conduct a reflected XSS attack against a user that is currently not logged in.
    1. Design an attack that fakes the Login form to attack users that are currently not logged in. Send the login information to a server of your choice and login the user normally afterwards.
    2. How can you hide the attack code to the victim? Implement an exemplary concealment.
The below link contains the assignment solution for both of the above mentioned scenarios [XSS](https://github.com/viveksacademia4git/InternetSecurity/blob/SQL-Injection-and-XSS/AngularXSS/lite-server/README.md)

2. Look for a place, where you can conduct a reflected XSS attack against a user that is currently logged:
   * Design an attack that reads information about the user and send it to a server of your choice. [ReflectiveXSS](https://github.com/viveksacademia4git/InternetSecurity/tree/SQL-Injection-and-XSS/AngularXSS/doc/ReflectiveXSS)

3. What would be your advice for the Altoro Mutual bank in order to close the vulnerabilities or to make exploiting them impossible?

## Exercise 3: API Information Disclosure
Link with documentation of the task completion [Web_security](https://github.com/sudo-kartik/Web_security/blob/master/assingment-3%20exercise%20-3.md)


## Exercise 4: Web Security in Practice
Develop a small web application in a programming language of your choice that initially is deliberately vulnerable to one of:
    • SQL-Injection, or
    • Cross-Site Request Forgery, or
    • Remote Code Execution

Explain where and why your code is vulnerable to the selected vulnerability and develop a fix for that.

The above task completion is documented in the issue: #22

Note: (Suggestion) Restrict the privileges of the database user assigned to interact with the database. 


## Exercise 5: Cross Origin Resource Sharing
